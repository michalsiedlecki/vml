Cucumber vs Test.Steps
This repository was created as part of a recruitment task. It presents two approaches to testing using Cucumber (located in the features folder) and test steps (located in the tests folder).

The test opens a webpage, enters an email address, clicks on "Forgot password," then logs into Gmail and clicks the password reset link.

Additionally, there is a second test that utilizes an email service and its API to check the email without interacting with the front end.
